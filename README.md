# Accuracy of Gender Detection of Queer Voices
Signal Processing final project. I built a gender classifier using CommonVoice data and tested it against queer voices (known celebrities, pulling clips listed in VoxCeleb 1 and 2)

## TODO: actually write out this readme

- I didn't upload the data because I can't control it. But I can link where I got the data from.
